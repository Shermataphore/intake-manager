# Manifest Manager

**Manifest Manager** is a Python GUI application that helps bring in products from Dutchie that have been accepted on Metrc.

## Overview

This tool opens in a new window and provides three tabs:

1. **Active Manifest**

   * Clones what is on the "Receive Inventory" page for Dutchie.

2. **Vendor Products**

   * Allows you to look up products by Dutchie vendor name so you can edit the vendor's products that are imported automatically.
